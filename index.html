<h2>Trail Running</h2>

<p>Hello World,</p>

<p>I’m Robert Thompson.  I normally just go by Rob.  This site is about a slice 
of my life.  It’s focused on an activity that I’ve become enamored with over 
the past two years.  Trail Running.  </p>

<p>On this site I will share with you some of the reasons why I think Trail 
Running is such a great activity.  We'll cover what you can expect when you 
run a trail, what a great local trail close to me looks like, and some tools 
to help with your own adventures in trail running.</p>

<p>Running is literally one of the first skills we learn.  You crawl, you walk, 
then lookout… you run accompanied by the sounds of laughter and big smiles.  
It’s an early joy in life as a child to run.</p>
	
<p>As we grow running becomes a fundamental component of most major sports that 
we learn as kids.  We run in baseball, basketball, football and soccer.  The 
health benefits that are important for our development as adolescents become 
even more important to maintain a healthy baseline as an adult.</p>

<h3>Running Benefits</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A Cardio exercise that's easily accessible.</li>
	<li>Great for increasing heart health.</li>
	<li>Reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
	<li>Burns calories and build endurance.</li>
	<li>Reduce stress and alleviate symptoms of depression.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it's pretty easy to see how great running is for us.

<p>I’ve gone through periods where I run on track surfaces or train on 
treadmills.  The track is the better workout but a lot harder on your joints 
than a treadmill.  The treadmill for me is just unengaging.  Also, anyone who’s 
put time into both know the false sense of running a good mile on a treadmill 
versus running a mile for real.  

<p>As a fan of mountain biking I had seen people hiking on dirt trails before.  
Every now and then I would come accross a runner.  On a whim I bought a pair of 
trail running shoes and tried it.  Little did I know what a great experience I 
had been missing all this time riding a mounatin bike on trails that I could 
have explored on foot.</p>

<h3>Trail Running Benefits</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Trails aren't as hard on your joints as pavement.</li>
	<li>Varied terrain to challenge and engage your mind.</li>
	<li>Better strength training than running on flat surfaces.</li>
	<li>Builds agility and balance moving across uneven terrain.</li>
</ul>
