<h2>Plan Your Run</h2>
<ol id="resourcesol">
	<li >First things first, you need to find a local trail.  I enjoy running 
	the firetrails around Liberty Reservoir west of Baltimore, MD.  
<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/">Alltrails.com</a> is a great source to 
find trails like Liberty and reviews of their condition.</li>
	<li>Make sure you dress for where youâ€™re going to run. Trails can be a 
	varied terrain that includes mud and rock. Given the extend time of trail 
	running it's not unusual for rain to pop-up on a run. Have a light running 
	jacket handy if there's a chance of rain.</li>
	<li>Make plans in terms of time on the trail and not distance run.  Trail 
	running can take a lot more time and covers less distance when compared
	to running on the road. An 8-minute mile on pavement is easily more than 16
	minutes on a trail.</li>
	<li>Learn to know where you are.  Trail running unlike a track or road 
	doesn't always present an easy sense of where you.  Trails that split and 
	overlap can quickly lead to losing your way.  A compass is a boon in this 
	situation.  Even better is a GPS to help when the path becomes unclear.  
	Alltrails has an app for download with a decent trail map and GPS.</li>
	<li>This might be an overlap of number 2 but it's important.  Get a good 
	good pair of shoes made for trail running.</li>

<h3>The Right Shoe</h3>

<p>A pair of normal running shoes won't work on a trail.  Trails can be muddy, 
sandy, rocky, and have extreme shifts in verticality.  A normal pair of running 
shoes will lead to disappoint at best and injury at worst.</p>

<p>Trail running shoes have a more aggressive tread or lugs on the bottom of 
the shoe to provide grip.  This goes from mild on some shoes to almost a cleat 
like bottom on the most aggressive.  You really need this when running on 
unpredictable paths.  Some inclines that would otherwise unpassable become 
doable with the right tread.</p>

<p>Trail running shoes have something called a <strong>Rock Plate</strong>.  
This is a midsole shank that protects your foot from bruising on impact with a 
rock edge mid stride.  This is an absolute must if the trail you're running has 
rocky spots.  The fire trails I run at Liberty Reservoir have a lot of rocky
 patches and I can tell the difference between wearing shoes with and 
 without some form of rock protection.</p>
 
<p>My preferred trail running shoes are from Inov-8.  Inov-8 has a great 
selection of shoes for hitting the outdoors.  My two favorites are the 
<a href="https://www.inov-8.com/us/roclite-g-275-mens-graphene-running-shoe">
ROCLITE</a> and 
<a href="https://www.inov-8.com/us/trailtalon-235-v2-mens">TRAILTALON.</a></p>
